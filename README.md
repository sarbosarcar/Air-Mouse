# Air-Mouse

## Overview
Air-mouse is a virtual mouse handling and operating tool allowing users to operate the mouse pointer using their hand gestures.

## Technical Description
The project uses the following modules and/or packages. The authors acknowledge the contributions made by open-source developers and creators working on these tools:
+ [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
+ [Mediapipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe)
+ [Mouse](https://github.com/boppreh/mouse) 

## Usage Guidelines
+ An outstretched index finger moves the pointer across the screen
+ The middle finger brought adjacent to the index finger resembles a left press on the mouse (note that the press is released only on moving the middle finger away

## Known Limitations
+ The video input is frequently jarred and consequently, continuous input feed is not obtained.
+ The clicking mechanism is under development and may invite inadvertent outputs
